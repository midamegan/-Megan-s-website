    <h1>Grease Facts</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Grease started off as a musical in 1971. It was created by an advertising copywriter named Jim Jacobs and a high school art teacher named Warren Casey. It was adapted into a film in 1978.</li>
<li>For the movie, a lyric from "Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee" was changed to something a little more sexual: "Elvis, Elvis, let me be! Keep that pelvis far from me!" Coincidentally, Elvis Presley died the same day the scene was filmed, August 16, 1977.</li>
<li> While filming, everyone in the primary cast was actually too old to be in high school. Director Randal Kleiser administered a "crow's-feet test"around their eyes to make sure they could pass for teens.</li>
<li>Instead of using makeup, Jeff Conaway (Kenickie) insisted on really giving Stockard Channing (Rizzo) real hickeys and he did! Remember, "A hickey from Kenickie is like a Hallmark card."</li>
<li>Jeff Conaway (Kenickie) injured his back while filming "Greased Lightning." Fellow cast members accidentally dropped him while dancing on top of a car. The injury eventually ignited his pain killer addiction, which led to his untimely death in 2011.</li>
<li>"Greased Lightning" was originally supposed to be Jeff Conaway's (Kenickie) song, like it is in the musical, but John Travolta (Danny) insisted he sing it. This caused a bit of tension on set.</li>
<li>It actually only took one day to film "You're the One That I Want" and the end scene. There was also a real traveling circus there.</li>
<li>The iconic dance contest took an entire week to film. It was shot in Huntington Park High School in Los Angeles. Temperatures reached a scorching 116 degrees during filming, which caused several extras to get mildly ill.</li>
<li> Believe it or not, the word "grease" is never said in the film, only "greased."</li>
